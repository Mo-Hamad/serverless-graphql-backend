# Serverless GraphQL Backend

This repository contains the backend for a serverless GraphQL API service built with Node.js and AWS services. It leverages AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to efficiently handle GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Overview
The serverless GraphQL backend processes incoming GraphQL requests and executes the required business logic. It serves as the core API layer for handling queries and mutations. Designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, it efficiently integrates with AWS services.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **AWS Lambda:** Serverless compute service.
- **API Gateway:** Manages API endpoints.
- **DynamoDB:** NoSQL database service.
- **Apollo Server:** GraphQL server implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm
- AWS CLI

### Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serverless-graphql-backend.git
cd serverless-graphql-backend
npm install
```

## Testing the Server

There are two main commands to interact with the server locally:

- To test the GraphQL function locally, run:
  ```bash
  npm run serverless
  ```
  This command executes:
  npm run compile && serverless invoke local -f graphql -p query.json

- To start the server in development mode (with live debugging and faster iteration), run:
  ```bash
  npm run serverless:deploy
  ```
  This command executes:
  npm run compile && serverless dev

## AWS Configuration
Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured:
```bash
aws configure
```
Provide your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key, and preferred region when prompted.

## Deployment
Deploy your application using the serverless framework. This process compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript before deployment. There are two primary ways to deploy:

- For a development deployment with live debugging, run:
  ```bash
  npm run serverless:deploy
  ```
  This command executes:
  npm run compile && serverless dev

- For a standard deployment, run:
  ```bash
  serverless deploy
  ```
  Make sure your configuration in `serverless.yml` is up to date before deploying.

## Project Structure
Key directories and files within the project include:
- **server.ts**: Application entry point for the Apollo Server.
- **graphql/**: Contains GraphQL schema definitions and resolvers.
- **config/**: Houses environment settings and configuration files.
- **migrations/**: Database migration scripts.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
  
Additional components and directories may evolve as the project grows.
